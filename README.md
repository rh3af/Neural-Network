# Neural-Network
This repository contains Python code for a simple implementation of a Neural Network and a Perceptron using the Numpy library.

## NeuralNetwork.py

### Description
The `NeuralNetwork.py` file contains the implementation of a basic neural network. The network is initialized with random synaptic weights and can be trained using training data. It utilizes the sigmoid activation function for forward propagation and backpropagation to adjust weights during training.

### Usage
To create and train the neural network
